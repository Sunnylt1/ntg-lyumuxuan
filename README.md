### Geospatial map in shiny app
### Here is a link to my app: http://mlyu.shinyapps.io/ntg-lyumuxuan
####(might take some time to load the data, or try this: http://127.0.0.1:5778/)

##### In this homework, I graphed the life expectancy in 2005, 2010, and 2016 on a world map. Clicking on a specific country only shows the country name but also shows the gender specific life expectancy in that specific country. The default setting of the bar plot is the average life expectancy across countries. If the country's life expectancy is higher than the average, the bar will cover the oringinal bar. However, if the country's life expectancy is lower than the average, a descrepency between two values will be shown.
